To run this project, you'd run it as we run any of the previous labs that we've done in the past. Below are two methods

METHOD 1: Usual class method-------
1) To run the server, open Terminal (for Mac) or Command Prompt (for Windows). Navigate to the folder where this project is downloaded in
2) You should now be in the project directory. Now we will run a python command which will create an HTTP web server for this current directory and all of its sub-directories. In the console execute the following command if you're running Python 2.   <python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080> if you're running Python 3.x or higher, use <python -m http.server 8080>  (or <python3 -m http.server 8080>) (copy the code inside the brackets <>, don't include the brackets)
3) Now, open your browser and type http://localhost:8080/ in the URL bar and press enter or go. You should see the visualization!

METHOD 2: The way we do it--------
1) Open VSCode
2) Download the extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
3) Open the visualization's project folder in VSCode
4) Right click on the 'index.html' file, and click "Open with live server"

It should then open in your browser!

Enjoy!!
